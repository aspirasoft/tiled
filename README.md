# TiledView: Tilemaps on Android
TiledView is a lightweight API for easily creating tile maps in Android. It is useful for applications and games which need to display tile-based graphics.

## The Tilemap Data Structure
Tilemaps are a very popular technique in 2D game development, consisting of building the game world or level map out of small, regular-shaped images called tiles. Think about any game that uses regularly repeating squares of background, and you'll probably find it uses tilemaps.

## Installation
Open the module level `build.gradle` file and add dependency to this library using:
```
dependencies {
  // ...
  implementation "co.aspirasoft.android.view:tilemap:${latestVersion}"
}
```

# How to Use
See the [demo app](https://github.com/saifkhichi96/tiled-view/tree/master/demo) for a usage example.
