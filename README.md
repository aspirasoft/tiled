# TiledView: Tilemaps on Android
TiledView is a lightweight API for easily creating tile maps in Android. It is useful for applications and games which need to display tile-based graphics.

## The Tilemap Data Structure
Tilemaps are a very popular technique in 2D game development, consisting of building the game world or level map out of small, regular-shaped images called tiles. Think about any game that uses regularly repeating squares of background, and you'll probably find it uses tilemaps.
